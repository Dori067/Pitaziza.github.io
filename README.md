`UPDATE!!!`
This is useless btw, but it was used for the thing to join a player using an extension in chrome without having their joins public

## A http request for roblox.

Uses the roblox's http API to get the current amount of players in a server and their (image) token to ask down the servers inside of a game to join the player's server.
